# SmartMuse: A music library 

### Description:

#### What will the application do?
The program will store songs and playlists. Specifically, it will be able to hold song name, artist name and song length
for songs in its library. The user will be able to add and create playlists. The user can see all songs in the playlist 
and add new songs to their library. Additionally, there will be a feature to favourite or dislike songs so that they 
organize their music preferences.


#### Who will use it?
Anyone who enjoys listening to music and wants to organize it.  

#### Why is this project of interest to you?
I love listening to music, and love making playlists for different moods, settings or activities.
