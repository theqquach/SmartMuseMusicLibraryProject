# SmartMuse: A playlist maker

### Description:

#### What will the application do?
The program will create playlists based on the users needs. Specifically, it will be able to create a playlist based 
on travel time to a users' destination. The user will be able to input a time length and the application will create a
playlist that will end around that time. The user can see all songs in the playlist and add new songs to their library.
Additionally, there will be a feature to favourite or dislike songs so that they show up more or less times in the
randomized playlist.


#### Who will use it?
Commuters, drivers, travellers, or anyone who listens to music and enjoys the satisfaction of the music ending right as 
you arrive at your destination. It can also be used as a timer for working out, studying or other activities.  

#### Why is this project of interest to you?
I love listening to music when I drive, but find it particularly irritating when I get home or wherever and the song
still has a minute or so left. It would also be nice for timed study sessions or workouts.
